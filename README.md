# Hi There! 
I am a Software Developer 💻 from Calgary, AB! 

I have an extensive background in developing web applications. I'm currently learning how to utilize the Cloud ☁️ for 
things such as automation ⚙️ and building high-scale distributed systems.

Nowadays I'd say I'm not so much interested in picking up new programming languages, but I am interested in using the right tool ⚒️ for the task. Whatever I'm trying to do, whether I know it or not does not matter. I'll figure it out.
